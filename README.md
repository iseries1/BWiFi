BRobot ESP8266 WiFi Code

You have a BRobot with an ESP8266 on it and you want to play with it but not sure where to start.

With this code load on the robot you will build a serial passthrough that you can use to send commands 
to the ESP8266 board and play around with it without removing it from the robot.

This code replaces the robot code and will not work as a robot once loaded.
You will need to reload the robot code to put the robot back in shape.
The ESP8266 is reprogrammed by the robot code each time it is started.
